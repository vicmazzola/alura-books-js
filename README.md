# AluraBooks

This project was developed as part of the **Alura course**: *JavaScript: Array Methods*. I previously created an **AluraBooks** project focused on practicing HTML, CSS, and responsiveness. This version expands on that foundation to cover advanced **JavaScript** techniques.

## 🔨 Project Features

- **Dynamic filtering** of book categories (e.g., Front-End, Back-End, Data).
- **Sorting functionality** to organize books by price.
- **Highlighting availability**, with a visual indicator for out-of-stock books.
- **Total price calculation** for available books.
- **Responsive design** optimized for multiple screen sizes.

## 🧠 What I Learned

This course focused on the practical use of JavaScript array methods to solve real-world problems, applied to the **AluraBooks** project:

- **forEach**: Iterating through arrays and performing actions for each element.
- **map**: Generating new arrays with modified elements (e.g., applying discounts).
- **filter**: Extracting subsets of data based on conditions.
- **sort**: Ordering lists by specific properties.
- **reduce**: Aggregating array values into a single result (e.g., calculating totals).

## ✔️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** for building the page structure.
- **CSS** for styling, enhanced with responsive design principles.
- **JavaScript** for dynamic interactions and manipulation of arrays and the DOM.
